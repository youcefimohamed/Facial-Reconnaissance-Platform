# Facial Recognition Platform

This is a simple facial recognition platform built using [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js).

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Face Capture and Registration

- Captures the user's face using the webcam.
- Saves the face data for future recognition.

### 2. Face Recognition

- Uses the webcam to detect and recognize previously registered faces in real-time.

The entire system relies on the webcam for both capturing and recognizing facial features using face-api.js.

## Technologies Used
